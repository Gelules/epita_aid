EPITA Assistants Intranet Downloader is a tool written in Python to download and
clone the git repositories from the intranet of the assistants at EPITA.

You need to download:
* geckodriver (from your package manager)
* gitpython, selenium, wget from a python package downloader.

Usage:
  ./epita_aid.py
You will be asked if you want to clone your repositories or not when the tool
adds the projects links.

It came as an old utility for me and a friend, not searching for any kind of
optimization or good quality of code.
